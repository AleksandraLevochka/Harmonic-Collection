    As an international student from Russia, adapting to a new city, especially one as vast and dynamic as New York, can be quite daunting. It can be frustrating when you've just left the comfort of your familiar surroundings. <br> I hope this collection can be a helpful guide for you, whether you need a guiding hand or a starting point. Have a wonderful time exploring New York!
