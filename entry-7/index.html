    <p class="paragraph1"> 
        Hello! I'm Aleksandra, or ✨simply✨ - Sasha. I am a sophomore at Parsons School of Design, studying BFA Communication Design. I’ve come a long way from my hometown, Moscow, to finally be here in New York. <br> As an international student from Russia, adapting to a new city, especially one as vast and dynamic as New York, can be quite daunting. It can be frustrating when you've just left the comfort of your familiar surroundings. Trust me, I've been there, but don't worry — I've got you!

        Traveling and exploring have always ignited my deepest passion - a passion sparked by my mom's influence. It's not just about seeing new cultures, indulging in new cuisines, and admiring local architecture and artists; it's about diving headfirst into the vibrant life in a new place, even if it's just a temporary escape from the daily grind!

        There is nothing more intimate and enchanting than having the opportunity to feel like a local in a new place, regardless of how long you stay there. New York has so much to offer, and I'm sure that as travelers, we're tired of seeing the same <em> "ToP mUsT vIsIt In NeW yOrK" </em> lists that always feature the typical tourist attractions like the Statue of Liberty, Times Square, Central Park, and other widely-known, Instagram-famous spots.

    <p class="paragraph4 custom-positioning"> 
        Personally, I have a love-hate relationship with the city. However, there's absolutely no excuse for you to miss the opportunity to experience the city from an off-the-beaten-path perspective.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph4">
        Exploring new places is a great way to immerse yourself, connect with your new home, and discover where to go for different experiences. In this list, I've compiled some unique, special, and lesser-known spots in NYC. I hope this collection can be a helpful guide for you, whether you need a guiding hand or a starting point.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p class="paragraph5">
        Have a wonderful time exploring New York! 
    </p>

        Yours, Sasha
