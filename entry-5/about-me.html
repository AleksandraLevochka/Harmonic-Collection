        Hello! I'm Aleksandra. Exploring new places is a great way to immerse yourself in a new culture, connect with your new home, and discover where to go for different experiences. In this list, I've compiled some unique, special, and lesser-known spots in New York City.

        As an international student from Russia, adapting to a new city, especially one as vast and dynamic as New York, can be quite daunting. It can be frustrating when you've just left the comfort of your familiar surroundings.

       I hope this collection can be a helpful guide for you,  whether you need a guiding hand or a starting point. Have a wonderful time exploring New York!
