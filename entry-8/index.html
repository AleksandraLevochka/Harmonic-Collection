        <p class="paragraph1">Before coming to New York as a student, I had this notion that the two cities shared quite a few similarities. My belief was rooted in the hazy memories of my childhood trips to the city when I was around 7 or 10 years old. To some extent, the hustle and bustle of both cities, the relentless pursuit of dreams during the day, and the leisurely moments spent with friends in cute restaurants in the evenings did seem to align. The cosmopolitan atmosphere, the constant influx of internationals â€“ it all hinted at a shared vibe.

                <br> <br> However, once I settled in New York, all of these aspects still couldn't spare me quite a few cultural shocks. It didn't take long, perhaps just a few months, for me to begin appreciating all the things I had taken for granted in Moscow. First and foremost, the tranquility of my home city stood out. Moscow, in comparison, felt much quieter, offering numerous green oases where you could actually breathe in some fresh, unpolluted air (NYC could never ðŸ’€).
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph1">And then, there was the matter of food and produce. I couldn't help but notice that the culinary scene in Moscow surpassed New York's. The flavors were bolder, the ingredients fresher and every meal seemed like a delightful explosion of taste. In contrast, New York's culinary landscape, while diverse, often left me yearning for the hearty and savory dishes I had grown up with.
